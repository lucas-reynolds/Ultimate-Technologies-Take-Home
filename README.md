## Part 2: Experiment and Metrics Design
Provided information:
* Gotham and Metropolis are neighboring cities with complementary circadian rhythms. On weekdays, Gotham is most active at night and Metropolis is most active during the day. On weekends, both cities have reasonable activity.
* Drivers tend to be exclusive to each city due to a toll bridge with a two-way toll between the city
* City operations have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities by reimbursing all toll costs.
Prompts:
1. What would you choose as the key measure of success of this experiement in encouraging driver partners to serve both cities and why would you choose this metric?
2. Describe a practical experiment you would esign to compare the effectiveness of the proposed change in relation to the key measure of success. Please provide details on:
  a. How would you implement the experiment?
  b. What statistical test(s) would you conduct to verify the significance of the observation?
  c. How would you interpret the results and provide recommendations to the city operations team along with any caveats?
